<H1>Hi there, I am Sarib ðŸ‘‹</H1>

I am a Master's Degree student in Politecnico Di Torino. I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I formally started my journey in this field in late 2021. I have always been passionate about Statistics and it's critical use in the field of analytics. Over the past two years, I have expanded my skillset in terms of programming languages, computer engineering  concepts, and various tools.
